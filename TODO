HINT: see next commit after cdd87983a0b8e026917b167a601d594ded29427d in github.com/dvdhrm/kmscon
(rm -fr * and then do patch -p1 -R <that commit> - and then diff that directory with wlterm/
And after you do it, remove libgtk-3-dev from preseed.cfg and remove building libtoytoolkit.a from vbox-stage and building term from post-install.sh and installer.tex, but do not remove term repo from github (and see term/TODO) and remove dependencies for building term from preseed.cfg

add --debug option like it is in wlterm in kmscon/ repo
