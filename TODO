Reasons for replacing gnome-terminal:

1. https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/367994/how-to-make-c-generate-a-given-control-sequence (wlterm does it wrong by default, as gnome-terminal)
2. KP_Enter in less search mode (/) gives ESCOM instead of doing the search (wlterm does it wrong by default, as gnome-terminal)
3. pass F1-F12 keys to the application (wlterm does it right by default, unlike gnome-terminal)
4. be able to adjust width of terminal to exactly 100 slots in fullscreen mode (customizing font size alone does not give exactly 100-slot width of window on some monitors); see -DNOTEBOOK for an example how I did it in "term" repo

Purge code which does not concern full-screen mode (i.e., decorations, maximize stuff, etc)

for useful info see git log cdd87983a0b8e026917b167a601d594ded29427d.. in ~/kmscon/

After you do everything, remove term/, wterm/, libtsm/ and kmscon/ repos.
