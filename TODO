purge gtk3 from here (i.e., remove gtk+-3.0 from Makefile) based on kmscon/
HINT: see next commit after cdd87983a0b8e026917b167a601d594ded29427d in kmscon/
(rm -fr * and then do patch -p1 -R <that commit> - and then diff that directory with wlterm/
And after you do it, remove libgtk-3-dev from preseed.cfg and see term/TODO

add --debug option like it is in wlterm in kmscon/ repo

Reasons for replacing gnome-terminal:

1. https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/367994/how-to-make-c-generate-a-given-control-sequence (wlterm does it wrong by default, as gnome-terminal)
2. KP_Enter in less search mode (/) gives ESCOM instead of doing the search (wlterm does it wrong by default, as gnome-terminal)
3. pass F1-F12 keys to the application (wlterm does it right by default, unlike gnome-terminal)
4. be able to adjust width of terminal to exactly 100 slots in fullscreen mode (customizing font size alone does not give exactly 100-slot width of window on some monitors); see -DNOTEBOOK for an example how I did it in "term" repo

Note, that contrary to wlterm/, in kmscon/ repo its own libtsm is used, not the one from libtsm/ repo.
